    <p1><strong>
      The secret to a flavorful pot roast is browning the meat and onions before
      roasting, which adds a rich meaty flavor and caramelized sweetness. This
      step is what separates our recipe from many others that use a slow cooker.
      And also unlike a slow cooker recipe, our sauce is simmered to reduce a
      little which concentrates the flavors. What you'll end up with is a roast
      that's fall-apart tender with a velvety sauce and delicious vegetables.

  <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
 <p><h3>1.</h3>Sprinkle the roast with 3 tablespoons of the salt, rubbing into the grain and covering all sides. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 3 hours and up to 3 days.</p>
 <p><h3>2.</h3>Arrange a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 275 degrees F.</p>
 <p><h3>3.</h3>Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large heavy pot or Dutch oven over high heat. Cook the meat, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a plate.</p>
 <p><h3>4.</h3>Reduce the heat to medium-high and heat the remaining 4 tablespoons oil in the pot. Cook the onions and the remaining 1 tablespoon salt, stirring occasionally, until browned but not completely cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes (it's ok if the onion wedges break apart). Add the garlic and tomato paste and cook, stirring occasionally, until the paste is brick red and the garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the wine and bay leaves and cook, stirring occasionally and scraping the bottom of the pot, until slightly reduced and you can no longer smell the alcohol, about 4 minutes. Add the flour, stir to coat the onions and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the broth and pepper and bring to a boil.</p>
 <p><h3>5.</h3>Nestle the meat and any accumulated juices into the onions. Arrange the carrots, celery and potatoes around the roast, pushing them into the onions and surrounding the beef. Cover and transfer to the oven. Cook until the meat is very tender but still holds its shape and is not falling apart, 3 to 3 1/2 hours. Let rest, covered, at least 45 minutes before serving.</p>
 <p><h3>6.</h3>Transfer the roast to a cutting board and remove the twine with scissors, if necessary. Slice against the grain. </p>
 <p><h3>7.</h3>Divide the vegetables among plates and arrange the sliced beef over top. Spoon sauce over the top garnish with parsley and chives.</p>
